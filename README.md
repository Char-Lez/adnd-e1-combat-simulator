# adnd-e1-combat-simulator
A quick combat simulator for AD&amp;D first edition.

The point is to be able to see how any given fight will likely go.  The simulator does not attempt to take into account anything more than sheet hack and slash.

You give it armor class, THACO, hit point and damage settings for both combatants, then let it run 1000 simulations and give you a report of who won.

It's not meant to be an all inclusive simulation, but to give a DM a likely feeling for how an encounter could play out.

It's all in Javascript, and all one file.  Download and save it if you like.
